6. now the 2nd section is the banner section. it shows a image with text on it.
7.the 3rd section has the search bar to take user input.
8. once the user enter the search query, we make the a fetch call to the pexels with the searched query. 
9. now we display the results from the api into the dom.
10. just below the search bar, we should display the 1st image from the results. and image title, and photographer name, and on explore more button, link the address to photographer page.
